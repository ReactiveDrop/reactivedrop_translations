[h1]New Campaign: Accident 32[/h1]

Mysterious, seemingly harmless green glowing gems are discovered under the ground of a populated area due to abnormal radioactivity levels. The company "AMBER" came to study this supernatural material. Findings are frightening and undocumented, kept away from the public. Gems are identified to be extremely dangerous, extraterrestrial materials comprised of mostly muons. Emitted radiation modifies all biological structures in a big vicinity.

Originally released in May of 2020 and May of 2022 on the Steam Workshop, Accident 32 is a six-mission campaign which combines two three-mission campaigns into one. Marines are set out to explore the mysterious complex and headquarters of the company called "AMBER" and face many threats. A bonus "AMBER Complex" mission is included which is the first three missions combined into one.

[h1]New Campaign: Adanaxis[/h1]

TODO

[h1]Collections: Weapons, Equipment, and Swarmopedia[/h1]

As promised when the Collections screen was added, the Swarmopedia has returned, better than ever! Unlock stats, tips, and short stories about aliens by killing them in the field. Add-ons can also create their own Swarmopedia entries or add content to existing ones.

With the Swarmopedia revamp comes a new screen for selecting weapons using a grid intended to speed up finding high-level weapons and help with muscle memory. Unlocking weapons by leveling up now also gives you access to their fact sheets, with precise statistics about range, damage, and more.

[h1]Mapping Competition 2023: "Boss Fight"[/h1]

This year, we're hosting our first annual community mapping competition, and what better place to start than at the end? The theme for this year is [b]Boss Fight[/b].

Create a mission or short campaign that contains a boss fight - a scripted encounter with some big bad that the marines must overcome. Will the boss be an alien, a group of aliens, or something completely new? Where will the mission take place? Why are the marines there? All of these questions and more are things you'll have to consider in the coming months.

Or, if you have a better idea, go ahead and make that instead! AS:RD mapping competition themes are optional.

Entries must be tagged with [b]BossFight2023[/b]. Competition starts today and ends August 1st. Prizes include unique ingame medals. If you need help getting started, check out the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/1/]Modding / Mapping Help and Tips[/url] forum.

[h1]In Case You Missed It[/h1]

Here are some highlights from updates since the previous anniversary:
[list]
[*]Workshop addons can now contain videos, and missions can define their own briefing background video, or even show part of the world as the background during briefing.
[*]We're Steam Deck verified! The game runs great on the Steam Deck, and players on Linux or who use a controller have also seen improvements.
[*]There are now medals you can earn by helping with the game's development, contributing to the Steam community hub, or participating in a season of Heroes of the Interstellar Armed Forces.
[*]The slow-opening vault doors used in many missions now have more accurate collision data, allowing you to step or shoot through a partially-opened door.
[*]The all-new mission selection screen includes support for bonus missions and new "endless" missions.
[*]We've added an advanced settings menu and an advanced audio settings menu.
[*]Restarting a mission no longer requires a loading screen.

[/list]

[h2]Mapping[/h2]
[list]
[*]Added npc_crow, npc_pigeon, and npc_seagull.
[*]Added npc_combine_s, npc_combine_shotgun, and npc_combine_elite. These soldiers lack the "swarm sense" of aliens, instead relying on sight, sound, and information from their squad. Mappers can optionally add info_node_hint to mark spots with cover for the Combine soldiers to use.
[*]Added npc_zombine, with mapper-configurable grenades.
[*]Added npc_hunter, for use with other Combine NPCs.
[*]Added npc_strider, npc_combinegunship, and npc_combinedropship for use in cinematics.
[*]asw_colonist is now randomized using a wider range of appearances. Set the skin number to change the color of their clothing.
[*]asw_env_shake can now be flagged to bypass user settings (a new convar has been added for disabling [i]all[/i] shakes regardless of this flag).
[*]Added env_headcrabcanister.
[*]Added script_intro.
[*]A new material proxy, LanguagePreference, can be used to change a texture based on the viewer's language preference. For example:
[code]UnlitGeneric {
    $basetexture "example/translated_texture_english"

    Proxies {
        LanguagePreference {
            default "example/translated_texture_english"
            schinese "example/translated_texture_schinese"
            french "example/translated_texture_french"
            resultvar "$basetexture"
        }
    }
}[/code]
[*]TileGen now expects rooms to be built for -alldetail mode (world brushes turn into func_detail, func_brush with a name starting with structure_ turns into a world brush).
[*]Improved the randomization of rd_tilegen_instance.
[*]rd_tilegen_instance now searches in reactivedrop/tilegen/instances rather than reactivedrop/tilegen/instance/ThemeName.
[*]TileGen now flattens instances before sending the map to VBSP, allowing TileGen room sets to be distributed in VPKs or on the workshop. This also means rd_tilegen_instance can be used within instances.
[*]TileGen maps now use toolsskybox for a level seal, allowing the use of light_environment and light_directional.
[*]asw_vehicle_jeep is now functional. Available vehicles without add-ons are the dune buggy from Half-Life 2 (models/buggy.mdl, scripts/vehicles/jeep_test.txt) which allows one driver, and the muscle car from Half-Life 2: Episode Two (models/vehicle.mdl, scripts/vehicles/jalopy.txt) which allows one driver and one passenger.
[*]trigger_asw_button_area now has options for overriding UI hints with custom text.
[*]trigger_asw_computer_area has been made more customizable:
[list]
[*]Mail and news articles can now optionally end with an image. Use Image, ImageWide, and ImageTall to add an image to a news file. For mail, use MailBody1Image, etc.
[*]Reactor status can be controlled via an input on the computer area, as an alternative to the old method of having an objective with a specific icon.
[*]Weather, reactor status, and stock market info can now be customized with keyvalues files. Additionally, the current temperature is no longer randomized every time the weather report is opened.
[/list]
[*]func_asw_fade now ignores collisions with grenades by default.
[/list]

[h2]VScript[/h2]
[list]
[*]Added a new method to marines: SetMarineRolls, which allows maps and challenges to change whether individual marines can jump.
[*]Inhabitable NPCs (such as marines) have a new method: SetControls, which overrides the value of asw_controls for anyone playing or spectating that character. Negative numbers cause the character to use the global setting.
[*]asw_vehicle_jeep has methods to override its camera, SetCameraControls, SetCameraPitch, SetCameraDist, and SetCameraHeight, with corresponding Get* methods. Setting a negative value causes the vehicle to use the global setting.
[*]asw_vehicle_jeep has methods to query the occupants: MaxPassengers(), GetDriver(), and GetPassenger(seat).
[*]asw_vehicle_jeep has methods to retrieve statistics: GetSpeed, GetMaxSpeed (in miles per hour), GetRPM, GetThrottle, HasBoost, and BoostTimeLeft.
