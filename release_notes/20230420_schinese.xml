		[h1]New Campaign: Accident 32[/h1]

		Mysterious, seemingly harmless green glowing gems are discovered under the ground of a populated area due to abnormal radioactivity levels. The company "AMBER" came to study this supernatural material. Findings are frightening and undocumented, kept away from the public. Gems are identified to be extremely dangerous, extraterrestrial materials comprised of mostly muons. Emitted radiation modifies all biological structures in a big vicinity.

		Originally released in May of 2020 and May of 2022 on the Steam Workshop, Accident 32 is a six-mission campaign which combines two three-mission campaigns into one. Marines are set out to explore the mysterious complex and headquarters of the company called "AMBER" and face a lot of threats. A bonus "AMBER Complex" mission is included which is the first three missions combined into one.

		[h1]Mapping Competition 2023: "Boss Fight"[/h1]

		This year, we're hosting our first annual community mapping competition, and what better place to start than at the end? The theme for this year is [b]Boss Fight[/b].

		Create a mission or short campaign that contains a boss fight - a scripted encounter with some big bad that the marines must overcome. Will the boss be an alien, a group of aliens, or something completely new? Where will the mission take place? Why are the marines there? All of these questions and more are things you'll have to consider in the coming months.

		Or, if you have a better idea, go ahead and make that instead! AS:RD mapping competition themes are optional.

		Entries must be tagged with [b]BossFight2023[/b]. Competition starts today and ends August 1st. Prizes include unique ingame medals. If you need help getting started, check out the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/1/]Modding / Mapping Help and Tips[/url] forum.

		[h1]In Case You Missed It[/h1]

		Here are some highlights from updates since the previous anniversary:
[list]
		[*]Workshop addons can now contain videos, and missions can define their own briefing background video, or even show part of the world as the background during briefing.
		[*]We're Steam Deck verified! The game runs great on the Steam Deck, and players on Linux or who use a controller have also seen improvements.
		[*]There are now medals you can earn by helping with the game's development, contributing to the Steam community hub, or participating in a season of Heroes of the Interstellar Armed Forces.
		[*]The slow-opening vault doors used in many missions now have more accurate collision data, allowing you to step or shoot through a partially-opened door.
		[*]The all-new mission selection screen includes support for bonus missions and new "endless" missions.
		[*]We've added an advanced settings menu and an advanced audio settings menu.
		[*]Restarting a mission no longer requires a loading screen.

[/list]

		[h2]Mapping[/h2]
[list]
		[*]Added npc_crow, npc_pigeon, and npc_seagull.

		[*]Added env_headcrabcanister.
		[*]Added script_intro.
		[*]A new material proxy, LanguagePreference, can be used to change a texture based on the viewer's language preference. For example:
[code]UnlitGeneric {
    $basetexture "example/translated_texture_english"

    Proxies {
        LanguagePreference {
            default "example/translated_texture_english"
            schinese "example/translated_texture_schinese"
            french "example/translated_texture_french"
            resultvar "$basetexture"
        }
    }

		[*]TileGen now flattens instances before sending the map to VBSP, allowing TileGen room sets to be distributed in VPKs or on the workshop. This also means rd_tilegen_instance can be used within instances.
		[*]TileGen maps now use toolsskybox for a level seal, allowing the use of light_environment and light_directional.
[/list]

		[h2]VScript[/h2]
[list]
		[*]Added a new method to marines: SetMarineRolls, which allows maps and challenges to change whether individual marines can jump.
