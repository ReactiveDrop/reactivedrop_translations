Later today, there will be [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/563560/view/3267945303133398273]a big update with lots of changes and new content[/url], but before we get to that, we're trying something new.

This week, any mission you complete will award twice as many experience points. Mathematically, there's never been a better time to unlock your arsenal or work towards that next promotion.

The double experience week will start at midnight UTC on April 20, 2023 and run for 8 days.
