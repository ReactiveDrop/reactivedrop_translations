# Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop Translations

This repository contains everything required to translate [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/) into any [language supported by Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/localization#supported_languages).  
You can also translate to an unsupported language but this will only work as a VPK add-on file through workshop.
