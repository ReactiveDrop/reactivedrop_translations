"[english]asw_bio_sarge"		"Joseph Conrad is a tough, experienced soldier. He's one of the few people to have survived a large-scale Swarm invasion, an experience which forged him into the driven man he is today. A strong commander, he leads both by example, and through the not-so-gentle application of verbal foot to ass. He knows his team well and pushes hard to keep them at their best."
"asw_bio_sarge"		"Joseph Conrad is een doorgewinterde, ervaren soldaat. Hij is één van de weinigen die een grote Zwerm invasie heeft overleefd, een ervaring die hem veranderd heeft in de doorzetter die hij vandaag de dag is. Een goede leider, hij begeleidt zowel door voorbeelden, als door niet-zo-aardige toepassingen van verbale voet op kont. Hij kent dit team goed, en doet zijn best om ze alert te laten blijven."
"[english]asw_bio_jaeger"		"Karl Jaeger is the son of the son of a corpsman, military to his war-hardened bones. He’s a hard-charging killing machine with a true warrior’s spirit. He believes in the soul-freeing joy of combat and has always suspected he'll die in the line of duty. And if that happens, well, he can’t imagine a better way to go."
"asw_bio_jaeger"		"Karl Jaeger is de zoon van de zoon van een korporaal, militair zijn is hem aangeboren. Hij is een doorgewinterde moordmachine met echte moed als een krijger. Hij gelooft in de ziel bevrijdende manier van vechten en heeft altijd verwacht te sterven tijdens zijn dienst. En als dat gebeurt, nou ja, hij kan geen betere manier bedenken om heen te gaan."
"[english]asw_bio_wildcat"		"Growing up, Wildcat hadn’t anticipated following in the footsteps of her military family. In school, she’d dreamed of corporate life, business suits, a nice corner office. But the swarm took that away. Every able-bodied man and woman in her age cohort was funneled into hopeless defense of the colonies. By the time she was twenty-five, the cause was lost-- the colonies decimated, her family dead and scattered. Wildcat transferred into an elite unit to continue the fight."
"asw_bio_wildcat"		"Toen ze opgroeide heeft Wildcat niet gedacht dat ze in de voetstappen zou treden van haar militaire familie. Op school droomde ze altijd van huisje-boompje-beestje, samen met een kantoorbaan. Maar de zwerm nam dit weg. Iedere gezonde man en vrouw van haar leeftijd werd gedwongen om mee te doen in de hopeloze verdediging van de kolonies. Toen ze vijfentwintig was, was het doel weg. De kolonies uitgedund, haar familie dood en verspreid. Wildcat heeft haarzelf overgeplaatst in een elite team om de strijd voort te zetten."
"[english]asw_bio_wolfe"		"Wolfe is an ex-con turned soldier. At his last sentencing, the judge gave him a choice: jail or the Interstellar Armed Forces. It was the chance he needed to turn his life around. He took top honors at boot camp, easily beating the other enlisted men at everything from hand-to-hand combat to special ordinance disassembly. When his sentence was up, he found that he not only liked military life, but was good at it--and was consequently offered a position in Special Ops."
"asw_bio_wolfe"		"Wolfe is een ex-gevangene, en nu soldaat. Tijdens de laatste uitspraak van de jury werd hem de keus gegeven: naar de gevangenis of werken voor de Intergalactische Leger Macht. Het was de kans die hij nodig had om zijn leven een andere draai te geven. Hij was de beste op het trainingskamp, hij versloeg de rest van de mannen makkelijk van hand-tot-hand gevechten tot het uit- en in elkaar te zetten van geweren. Toen zijn vonnis erop zat, was hij er niet enkel achtergekomen dat hij dit leven leuk vond, maar dat hij er ook goed in was--en kreeg een aanbod om de Speciale Machten te versterken."
"[english]asw_bio_faith"		"Faith has the heart and soul of a medic. She's here to help people and believes in the Interstellar Armed Forces' mission to protect the Allied Systems against hostile alien assault. Despite having seen plenty of action, she’s still genuinely impacted by the human tragedy she sees and tends to take losses personally. She's deeply concerned for the welfare of her team."
"asw_bio_faith"		"Faith heeft het hart en de ziel van een echte heler. Ze is hier om mensen te helpen, en gelooft in de Intergalactische Gewapende Machten hun missie om de Geallieerde Systemen te beschermen tegen vijandelijke zwerm aanvallen. Ook al heeft ze haar portie actie al gehad, ze is nog steeds echt onder de indruk van de tragedia die plaats heeft gevonden, en ze neemt alle verliezen persoonlijk op. Ze geeft veel om de gezondheid van haar team."
"[english]asw_bio_bastille"		"Leon Bastille was born on a prison world, child of a political prisoners; when political tides shifted, his family was released. It was a world run by black marketeers, where he learned basic medicine hands-on. He also received a strong, if informal, academic education (the prison being full of philosophers, authors, educators, poets and priests). Bastille is naturally suspicious of others, but also an excellent combat medic."
"asw_bio_bastille"		"Leon Bastille is geboren op een wereld met gevangen, kind van politieke gevangenen; toen de politieke kwesties opgelost waren, werd zijn familie vrijgelaten. Het was een wereld die bestuurd werd door zwarte markten, waar hij de helende krachten toegestopt kreeg. Hij heeft een goede academische opleiding gekregen (de gevangenis zat vol met filosofen, auteurs, leraren, dichters en priesters). Bastille vertrouwt niet snel mensen, maar is zeker een goede heler."
"[english]asw_bio_crash"		"David Murphy, reputedly a child hacker genius at tech school, didn't take long to fall onto the wrong side of the law. At the age of 21, he was responsible for the notorious Starbase Systems Crash, allegedly costing the Trade Leagues millions in lost credits. Murphy is now serving time in the IAF as part of his sentence."
"asw_bio_crash"		"David Murphy, een meesterbrein in het hacken van computers toen hij al klein was. Het duurde niet lang voordat hij aan de verkeerde kant van de wet terecht kwam. Toen hij 21 was, was hij verantwoordelijk voor de beruchte Starbase Systemen Crash, wat de Ruil Leagues miljoenen credits heeft gekost. Murphy dient nu de Intergalactische Gewapende Machten als onderdeel van zijn veroordeling."
"[english]asw_bio_flynn"		"Flynn's face is marred by a huge scar running across his left eye. He's a scrappy born fighter, raised on a grudge-world, settled by warring societies pursuing a deliberate generations-old feud, wracked by perpetual civil war. He's most comfortable with streetwar, guerrilla tactics, and dirty fighting. He's also most comfortable with large weapons. The bigger, the better. He talks little, his one good eye ever watchful."
"asw_bio_flynn"		"Flynn zijn gezicht is gemarkeerd met een gigantisch litteken over zijn linkeroog. Hij is een geboren vechter, opgevoed op een haatdragende wereld, bezet door vechtende gemeenschappen die een generatie oude vete uitvechten. Hij voelt zich het meest op gemak met grote wapens. Des te groter, des te beter. Hij is geen echte prater, zijn ene goede oog altijd oplettend."
"[english]asw_bio_vegas"		"Vegas has an almost savant-like talent for counting and memorization, a skill he put to use in various gambling houses where he won big at poker and blackjack tables. However, fortune is fickle, and after racking up massive debts and angering some important people, he had to get out. Vegas joined the IAF so he could earn the money to pay back his debts (or a sizeable seed fund with which to win back the rest), and to get away from people who want to crush his kneecaps."
"asw_bio_vegas"		"Vegas heeft een bijna goddelijk talent om te rekenen en om dingen te onthouden, een vaardigheid die hij heeft gebruikt om verscheidene casino's te bedriegen waar hij grote getallen heeft gewonnen met pokeren. Maar geluk is er niet altijd, en nadat hij flinke schulden had opgehoopt en een paar belangrijke mensen heeft boos gemaakt, moest hij daar weg. Hij ging bij de Intergalactische Gewapende Machten om het geld terug te verdienen (of een goed bedrag om de rest terug te winnen) en om van de mensen weg te komen die al zijn botten wilden breken."

		// "Basebees" is a portmanteau of "baseball" and "bees" because they're baseball-shaped bees.
		// in the game of baseball, a runner is "tagged out" if a player on the opposing team touches them with the baseball before they can reach a base. doing this means they must stop running and are "out". (but tagging them with something else, like an empty glove or a bee, does nothing.)
		// to explain "fielding all the pieces": in the game of baseball, after the batter hits the ball, they will run around the bases. if the batter hits the ball hard enough (and in the right direction), it will land in the outfield. The outfield is between the bases and the edge of the field where the spectator seats are. It's the "outfield" because it's the outer part of the field. Anyways, the job of the outfielders is to stand in the outfield, catch any balls that are hit their way, and throw those balls to their teammates on first, second, third, and home base so that they can tag the runner out. (This is a simplification of the actual rules, but it will hopefully suffice.) This process of catching the ball and throwing it where it needs to be is called "fielding". A player that successfully catches and throws the ball where it needs to go is a "good fielder". In this case, this is difficult to do with an exploded ball because you have to catch all the pieces and tag the runner with all of them! This might be able to be simplified to "you have to catch all the pieces" or something.
		// regarding "mercy rule": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule
		// the last line is a play on the American English idiom "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."

The bees are not as effective as you might think - they find it hard to lift the gloves and put them in the way of the ball, even if they can fly. They mainly affect the game by being about the same shape as a baseball, so you gotta make sure you're getting tagged out by the right orb. If you get tagged out by a bee, you can keep running! I did manage to get Big Report spitting baseballs before the big game, even if they are covered in a thin layer of time bomb juice. This usually led to the balls either going off in the catcher's mitt (relatively harmless once we armored the glove) or exploding in midair after the hit. Very pretty, but it turns out that if the ball explodes, you have to field all the pieces. Long story short, the mercy rule made us call the game once we were losing 68 to 1. I still count it as a success. It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you taught a bomb-spitting space bug to play the game."

We found his journal abandoned on Deck 2. If I had to guess, I'd say he dropped it shortly before his demise. It's scratched in a way that's consistent with what we know about drone claws, so it's possible he was attacked. We never found a body, so he either got himself devoured or managed to throw himself into the waste disposal or something. The man who doomed Jacob's Rest died relatively quickly to the swarm he unleashed and the innocent people he doomed never had a chance. If he made any effort to repair the fire suppression system or restore power to the oxygen scrubbers, there's no record of it anywhere. There are multiple entries outlining the movement of grubs on his body in frankly unnecessary detail, but not a moment's consideration for the people he imperiled.

By manipulating subatomic vibrations, the transducer instantly cools the cage by approximately five degrees Celsius and maintains that temperature gradient indefinitely with very little additional energy required. Since the cold rapidly saps a captured antlion's energy, the walls only require minimal reinforcement. This alone makes them much easier to move around than the old freezer-on-wheels horse truck design! If our remaining tests pass, I will recommend we begin keeping these so-called horses in BOOTS.
