	"MailBody1A"	"Just keeping you updated on the pipe check - I haven't found any administration papers on the east pipe 5B, which is a little weird. Not sure what function it serves or where it leads to. Either way, I have informed the engineers about it, they will take a look at it next week."
	"MailBody1B"	"Another problem is some strange sounds coming from the left wall of the main corridor entrance."
