	"MailBody1A"	"You said you would shut down the reactor if the temperature suddently became unstable again, but that was a fucking lie! It's been unstable since May and I have no idea how the Reactor hasn't exploded yet!"
	"MailBody1B"	"WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN THE REACTOR NOW! I don't care about the specimen outbreak in Sectors 3 and 4 and what AMBER says about the danger of infestation, Reactor is our main concern right now."
	"MailBody1C"	"With fucking regards, Leonid Toptunov."
