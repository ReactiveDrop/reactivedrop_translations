"MailBody3A"	"We shouldn’t have forced Lieutenant Florenza’s hands. He’s an idealist, with principles and loyal men. And now he’s coming at me. At what might have been a life’s work."
"MailBody3B"	"I suppose one can overlook pain and suffering as long as it’s out of reach, out of sight. But one cannot possibly ignore the tortured pup crying in their own backyard. Conscience...can be such a burden. I should know, of all people."
"MailBody3C"	"So be it. Let SynTek have their little discovery in the end, for a price only us paid."

"MailBody4A"	"Dear Vesta, this will be my final message. To whomever finds it, here is my request for Humanity:"
"MailBody4B"	"My name is Jacques Valery Moreau. As chief scientist of the research projects undertaken within the Lugdunum’s mission and colony, I have regulated and personally carried out experiments that were not only repulsive to professional ethics, but excruciating towards any type of reason or sense of morality. I now implore the military forces who’ll come upon my message to preserve the products of this effort. Protect them if you can, from those above who would use it for themselves. So that our species still progresses in adversity. As there is no odyssey without struggles, no science is without sacrifices."
"MailBody4C"	"Ves ta--gHelen. My flower, my fulcrum. If there is a place after death, I fear no god will allow me to join you there."
"MailBody4D"	"Nam Humanum"
