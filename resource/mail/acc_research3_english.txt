	"MailBody1A"	"Me, HD, Brad and Orion conducted an experiment to check specimen's immunity to high temperatures. We received shocking results. The HARVESTERs get stimulated by high temperatures which allows their body to produce a ton of XENOMITEs."
	"MailBody1B"	"When the Research Sector was built in July of last year, I've seen a HARVESTER escape to vents, which I thought was nothing to be scared about and I haven't told anybody about it."
	"MailBody1C"	"I was WRONG! I should have told everyone, THIS IS MY FAULT. The XENOMITEs created by HARVESTERs lay eggs which later hatch to much scarier, mutated versions of XENOMITEs."

	"MailBody2A"	"Do you fucking realise what this means!? The HARVESTER that escaped to the vents had plenty of time to create A GIANT COLONY IN THE UNDERGROUND SECTION."
	"MailBody2B"	"I have told this to Lt. Wanman and he had sent a team of 23 soldiers to investigate the underground sector. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM DIED."
	"MailBody2C"	"WE ARE ALL IN GRAVE DANGER, there are at least a couple hundred fully grown specimen 95 meters under our feet."
	"MailBody2D"	"I will try to spread this information to as many scientists and engineers working at Power Sector, and I don't care if I get punished, THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW!"
