	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: A colony in mourning"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"    "Today’s a sad day for Lugdunum. Miss Moreau, Helen, passed away suddenly following complications caused by a malignant tumor. Although I can’t claim to have known her well... I believe I knew enough. Her warm, youthlike eagerness in making this colony hospitable was cherished by many members of our community and...in our own way, I have no doubt each of us will be carrying this grief."
	"MailBody3C"    "I am deeply touched for Dr. Moreau. I wouldn’t dare imagine what would become of me if you or Isaac were to disappear. I think of you two every long night that passes by on this cold, distant planet."
	"MailBody3D"    "Nam Humanum."
