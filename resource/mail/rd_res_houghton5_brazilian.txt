"MailBody1A" "The mines should be a short way ahead, but I've got more bad news."
"MailBody1B" "We've deciphered some of the intel found in RC7, and it looks like some swarm were sighted deep in the mines."
"MailBody1C" "To make matters worse we're detecting a large concentration of swarm biosignatures coming from the mines."
"MailBody1D" "Just heard that they've had to nuke Timor Station up on Vareon XII. Let's hope it doesn't come to that."
