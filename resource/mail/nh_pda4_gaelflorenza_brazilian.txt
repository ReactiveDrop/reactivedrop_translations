	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Unexpected discovery"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"    "As I’m writing, several hours have passed since our last expedition’s return, in which I was conducting the Stibius research party in exploring an uncharted part of our maps. Geologists had uncovered, thanks to their radar equipment, the location of a cavernous complex hidden thus far under ice. I, at first and like many, thought nothing of it. After 21 months on this rock, what could have possibly dwelled beneath that we didn’t already know? Well, we dug to find out. And soon, before our non-believers’ eyes stood an enormous cave whose walls unraveled clusters of yellowish spores somewhat resembling terrestrial mushrooms, like a canvas colored by the light of our torches. We managed to contact the biological canton, who naturally took over the prospecting operations in a most eager fashion."
	"MailBody3C"    "Dr. Moreau and his colleagues are in intellectual turmoil right now. I’m not so sure what greater implications such a discovery is bound to entail, but this situation goes well beyond me anyway. I’m more than happy to leave it in the hands of competent authorities whose job is to actually know about these sorts of things."
	"MailBody3D"    "Nam Humanum."
