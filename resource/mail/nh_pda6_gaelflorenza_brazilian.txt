	"MailBody3B"	"Iris, love of my life. This message, just like the last one I sent you, will be intercepted by the comms team at the time I have scheduled its transmitting, 3 hours from now. But perhaps someday will it finally reach you, one way or another."
	"MailBody3C"    "I am about to take arms against Moreau and his inhumane experiments. I have the support of many settlers, as well as the back of my unit. In spite of that, I fear and know it may well be a one-way ticket for a number of us. I am sorry, my love. I have tried to convince myself of the merit of it all, truly. I am sorry, for you and the boy who will never get to know me. But how could I be the father of a child with no humanity left to impart."
	"MailBody3D"    "Forever yours."
