	"MailBody1A"	"Glenkor's radiation readings were correct. We have found an abnormal amount of radiation in a cave below a canal to the east of J7 Connector."
	"MailBody1B"	"Source of radiation - weird transparent rocks. They are like foggy glass but very tough. It hurts to hold it in my hand."
	"MailBody1C"	"Biggest size we found so far is roughly a 7.5 centimeter cube, was hard to get it out of the cave ceiling, had to break it down in two pieces."

	"MailBody2A"	"Woah, huge find! You won't believe it - over 2 meter tall and wide one, 100 meters below the entrance to the cave. No idea how will we get it out, though. Should we even?"
