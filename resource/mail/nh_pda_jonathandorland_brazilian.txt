	"MailFrom3"		"To: Dr. Lin Da Silva"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 03/31/43"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: What’s going on?"
	"MailBody3A"	"Lin, care to explain what’s going on out there?"
	"MailBody3B"    "It’s been over an hour since a group of settlers, led by Lieutenant Florenza and more of the custodians, broke into support staff quarters and insisted that we’d be confined inside the warehouse’s secured premises until further notice. Running and yelling ensued, then nothing. If you’d be so inclined, Doctor, of letting us know what the hell is going on around here? Nothing to do with dear old Moreau, I’m sure..."
	"MailBody3C"    "Maybe it’s the dehydration, but it feels like we’re going crazy in here. Some of us are hearing noises inside the walls. Just great, really. If I don’t hear from you by the end of the rotation period, I’ll have to use my one-use access key to force open the doors. Kind of a gamble, I know and I’m sorry. But it’s one the circumstances seem bent on me taking, don’t they?"
	"MailBody3D"    "Talk about a wild card."
