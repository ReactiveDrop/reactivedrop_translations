	"MailBody1C"     "As for the chainsaw, toss it off a cliff or something. Some idiot ordered a load of them by mistake and I've had them sitting in the warehouse taking up space ever since. As if we'd need chainsaws on this rock!"

Could you make sure we get the medical supplies in the next delivery. In the meantime, I'll have someone send the chainsaw back to you."
	"MailBody3C"	"Why do we even have chainsaws anyway???"
