"MailBody1A" "Man, that was some weird shit that went down earlier."
"MailBody1B" "When Bennings ran up to me, I thought that he and Mac 
had gone crazy. Maybe Mac already has?"
"MailBody1C" "And who would have thought that the flamethrower would actually come in handy?"

"MailBody2A" "Not that i'm complaining, it definately saved our asses but doesn't it seem a little irresponsible leaving a highly
volatile and downright dangerous weapon in the hands of a bunch of researchers with little to no outside contact
for months on end?"
"MailBody2B" "i mean all it takes is one of us to go a little nutty and we're all toast."

"MailBody3A" "It begs the question, we're artic researchers not soldiers, what the hell are we doing with a flamethrower?
what possible purpose does it serve us? why is it here?"
"MailBody3B" "on that note keep an eye on Dr.Blair, he's seemed a bit on edge since the kennel incident."
