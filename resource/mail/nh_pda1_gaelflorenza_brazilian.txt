	"MailFrom3"		"To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 01/18/40"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Sound landing"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"	"The communications team asks that I keep any written transmission brief while the installation is being worked on, so there you go. We finally landed on Cassius-III. As expected, the weather isn’t the gentlest out here. Not to mention that we’re still largely depending on the shuttle’s vitals. Still, everyone’s already doing their best to make it feel like a home. Pictured like something worthy of a tale. But I guess these letters will have to do, from this snowy island of mine to where you are now, an ocean of stars away."
	"MailBody3C"	"It’s been 5 months since I’ve farewelled your harbor, dear Iris, but it already feels like an eternity at sea. I aim to make this modest colony a proper shelter for you and me, and for the little man growing inside of you."
	"MailBody3D"	"Nam Humanum."

	"MailFrom4"		"To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate4"		"Date: 02/07/40"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: A dream beginning"
	"MailBody4A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody4B"	"I’ve been informed that any message I’ll forward may travel for some time before it reaches you. The reason for it is...well, some technical gibberish I won’t get into, for you own sake. I hope all is well, for you and the baby. Construction out here is carrying on, the installation of the research complex standing as a monument to our progress. Geological expeditions won’t take place for another few months though, about enough time for the life support systems to read green."
	"MailBody4C"	"The mission’s chief scientists, Miss and Mister Moreau conduct the operations with enthusiasm, inspiration even. Settlers have taken to calling them “Lugdunum’s Adam and Eve”. Seeing it put some much-needed smiles on their faces is somewhat reassuring, although I couldn’t really explain why. What I’m certain of is that I’ll keep writing until we’re both here, together too. Who knows, maybe once we’ve built our own kindergarten."
	"MailBody4D"	"Nam Humanum."
