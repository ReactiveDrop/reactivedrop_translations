He's one of the few people to have survived a large-scale Swarm invasion, an experience which forged him into the driven man he is today. A strong commander, he leads both by example, and through the not-so-gentle application of verbal foot to ass. He knows his team well and pushes hard to keep them at their best."
"asw_bio_sarge"		"Joseph Conrad é um soldado experiente e duro. Ele é uma das poucas pessoas a sobreviver uma invasão de Swarm a larga escala, uma experiência que o transformou no homem dedicado que é hoje. Um comandante forte, ele lidera não só por exemplo mas também pela aplicação não-tão-gentil de um pontapé no rabo verbal. Ele conhece a sua equipa bem e pressiona-os constantemente para mantê-los no seu melhor."
"[english]asw_bio_jaeger"		"Karl Jaeger is the son of the son of a corpsman, military to his war-hardened bones. He’s a hard-charging killing machine with a true warrior’s spirit. He believes in the soul-freeing joy of combat and has always suspected he'll die in the line of duty. And if that happens, well, he can’t imagine a better way to go."
"asw_bio_jaeger"		"Karl Jaeger é o filho do filho de um tropa, militar até aos seus ossos enrijecidos pela guerra. Ele é uma máquina de matar poderosíssima com o espírito de um verdadeiro guerreiro. Ele acredita na felicidade libertadora do combate e sempre suspeitou que morreria na linha do dever. E se isso acontecer, bem, ele não consegue imaginar uma melhor maneira de partir."
		"[english]asw_bio_wildcat"		"Growing up, Wildcat hadn’t anticipated following in the footsteps of her military family. In school, she’d dreamed of corporate life, business suits, a nice corner office. But the swarm took that away. Every able-bodied man and woman in her age cohort was funneled into hopeless defense of the colonies. By the time she was twenty-five, the cause was lost-- the colonies decimated, her family dead and scattered. Wildcat transferred into an elite unit to continue the fight."

		"[english]asw_bio_wolfe"		"Wolfe is an ex-con turned soldier. At his last sentencing, the judge gave him a choice: jail or the Interstellar Armed Forces. It was the chance he needed to turn his life around. He took top honors at boot camp, easily beating the other enlisted men at everything from hand-to-hand combat to special ordinance disassembly. When his sentence was up, he found that he not only liked military life, but was good at it--and was consequently offered a position in Special Ops."

She's here to help people and believes in the Interstellar Armed Forces' mission to protect the Allied Systems against hostile alien assault.

"[english]asw_bio_bastille"		"Leon Bastille was born on a prison world, child of a political prisoners; when political tides shifted, his family was released. It was a world run by black marketeers, where he learned basic medicine hands-on. He also received a strong, if informal, academic education (the prison being full of philosophers, authors, educators, poets and priests). Bastille is naturally suspicious of others, but also an excellent combat medic."
"asw_bio_bastille"		"Leon Bastille nasceu no mundo da prisão, filho de prisioneiros políticos. Quando mudaram as marés da política, a sua família foi libertada. Era um mundo governado por contrabandistas do mercado negro, onde aprendeu as bases da medicina em primeira mão. Também recebeu uma forte educação académica, se bem que informal (a prisão era populada por filósofos, autores, professores, poetas e padres). Bastille é desconfiado dos outros por natureza, mas também é um excelente médico de combate."

He's a scrappy born fighter, raised on a grudge-world, settled by warring societies pursuing a deliberate generations-old feud, wracked by perpetual civil war. He's most comfortable with streetwar, guerrilla tactics, and dirty fighting. He's also most comfortable with large weapons. The bigger, the better. He talks little, his one good eye ever watchful."

However, fortune is fickle, and after racking up massive debts and angering some important people, he had to get out. Vegas joined the IAF so he could earn the money to pay back his debts (or a sizeable seed fund with which to win back the rest), and to get away from people who want to crush his kneecaps."

		// "Basebees" is a portmanteau of "baseball" and "bees" because they're baseball-shaped bees.
		// in the game of baseball, a runner is "tagged out" if a player on the opposing team touches them with the baseball before they can reach a base. doing this means they must stop running and are "out". (but tagging them with something else, like an empty glove or a bee, does nothing.)
		// to explain "fielding all the pieces": in the game of baseball, after the batter hits the ball, they will run around the bases. if the batter hits the ball hard enough (and in the right direction), it will land in the outfield. The outfield is between the bases and the edge of the field where the spectator seats are. It's the "outfield" because it's the outer part of the field. Anyways, the job of the outfielders is to stand in the outfield, catch any balls that are hit their way, and throw those balls to their teammates on first, second, third, and home base so that they can tag the runner out. (This is a simplification of the actual rules, but it will hopefully suffice.) This process of catching the ball and throwing it where it needs to be is called "fielding". A player that successfully catches and throws the ball where it needs to go is a "good fielder". In this case, this is difficult to do with an exploded ball because you have to catch all the pieces and tag the runner with all of them! This might be able to be simplified to "you have to catch all the pieces" or something.
		// regarding "mercy rule": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule
		// the last line is a play on the American English idiom "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."

It's typically said to emphasize the importance of sportsmanship (playing fair, losing gracefully, etc.)

True to their name, the Orbs managed to genetically engineer some ball-shaped basebees to play outfield. I think they heard we had an insect player and refused to be outdone. The bees are not as effective as you might think - they find it hard to lift the gloves and put them in the way of the ball, even if they can fly. They mainly affect the game by being about the same shape as a baseball, so you gotta make sure you're getting tagged out by the right orb. If you get tagged out by a bee, you can keep running! I did manage to get Big Report spitting baseballs before the big game, even if they are covered in a thin layer of time bomb juice. This usually led to the balls either going off in the catcher's mitt (relatively harmless once we armored the glove) or exploding in midair after the hit. Very pretty, but it turns out that if the ball explodes, you have to field all the pieces. Long story short, the mercy rule made us call the game once we were losing 68 to 1. I still count it as a success. It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you taught a bomb-spitting space bug to play the game."

"Rest In Peace" (often shortened to RIP, originally the Latin "requiescat in pace") is the stereotypical thing to say when someone dies, often seen written on gravestones and the like. "Rest in pieces" is a pun, here used to disrespect the dead (who may or may not have literally been torn to pieces)
		// "eat shit" can mean a lot of things in English, but here it's short for "eat shit and die", and is basically used as a synonym for "fuck you". (i'm allowed to say "shit" but not "fuck" in the swarmopedia)

Before they learned the proper term, a lot of people started referring to these as \"horses\". They may lack the graceful spark of the horses we have on Earth, but I must admit I see the resemblance. Perhaps the humble Earth horse could take a few pages from the antlion's book. The hard head would make them difficult to pet, to be sure, but I think they're on to something with the colors. The glowing antlion guardians add a certain dashing rainbow charm to what is normally a drab, if handsome, brown."

		// "it needs to be about twenty percent cooler" is an ancient, popular My Little Pony joke that comes from this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L83cTan6ESk It was popular enough that it's been turned into songs, t-shirts, and other media, but that clip is the original.

		// "Baryon Oscillation Obstructive Transport System" and "baryonic transducer" are arbitrary technobabble as setup for the rest of the paragraph. Feel free to change it as needed. This is hard to explain, but the short version is "a horse sitting in a boot and saying 'love wins' is an inside joke". It started by putting an emoji of a horse head (originally Graceful Spark's) over the boot emoji and noticing that they fit well together, and it grew from there.
		// "horse truck" is used here as "a machine you use to move horses around" and as a reference to the above My Little Pony podcast, "We Were Hit By A Horse Truck And Got Isekai'd Into Equestria?".
		"[english]rd_so_paragraph_antlionguard_3"		"To this end, we're developing the Baryon Oscillation Obstructive Transport System, and I'm pleased to announce that early reports look promising. It consists of a baryonic transducer and a holding cell scarcely larger than an antlion guard. By manipulating subatomic vibrations, the transducer instantly cools the cage by approximately five degrees Celsius and maintains that temperature gradient indefinitely with very little additional energy required. Since the cold rapidly saps a captured antlion's energy, the walls only require minimal reinforcement. This alone makes them much easier to move around than the old freezer-on-wheels horse truck design! If our remaining tests pass, I will recommend we begin keeping these so-called horses in BOOTS. That would be a lovely win for all of us trying to safely learn more about these fascinating creatures."

They're quite fond of apples, jackfruit, and the occasional gourd. We've begun giving our captive antlions hollowed-out watermelons filled with other food, and they seem to enjoy the challenge!
