Ele é uma das poucas pessoas a sobreviver uma invasão de Swarm a larga escala, uma experiência que o transformou no homem dedicado que é hoje. Um comandante forte, ele lidera não só por exemplo mas também pela aplicação não-tão-gentil de um pontapé no rabo verbal. Ele conhece a sua equipa bem e pressiona-os constantemente para mantê-los no seu melhor."
"[english]asw_bio_sarge"		"Joseph Conrad is a tough, experienced soldier.  He's one of the few people to have survived a large-scale Swarm invasion, an experience which forged him into the driven man he is today.  A strong commander, he leads both by example, and through the not-so-gentle application of verbal foot to ass.  He knows his team well and pushes hard to keep them at their best."
"asw_bio_jaeger"		"Karl Jaeger é o filho do filho de um tropa, militar até aos seus ossos enrijecidos pela guerra. Ele é uma máquina de matar poderosíssima com o espírito de um verdadeiro guerreiro.

He believes in the soul-freeing joy of combat and has always suspected he'll die in the line of duty.  And if that happens, well, he can’t imagine a better way to go."
		"asw_bio_wildcat"		"Growing up, Wildcat hadn’t anticipated following in the footsteps of her military family.  In school, she’d dreamed of corporate life, business suits, a nice corner office.  But the swarm took that away.  Every able-bodied man and woman in her age cohort was funneled into hopeless defense of the colonies.  By the time she was twenty-five, the cause was lost-- the colonies decimated, her family dead and scattered.  Wildcat transferred into an elite unit to continue the fight."
