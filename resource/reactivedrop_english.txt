"asw_bio_sarge"	"Joseph Conrad is a tough, experienced soldier. He's one of the few people to have survived a large-scale Swarm invasion, an experience which forged him into the driven man he is today. A strong commander, he leads both by example, and through the not-so-gentle application of verbal foot to ass. He knows his team well and pushes hard to keep them at their best."
"asw_bio_jaeger"	"Karl Jaeger is the son of the son of a corpsman, military to his war-hardened bones. He’s a hard-charging killing machine with a true warrior’s spirit. He believes in the soul-freeing joy of combat and has always suspected he'll die in the line of duty. And if that happens, well, he can’t imagine a better way to go."
"asw_bio_wildcat"	"Growing up, Wildcat hadn’t anticipated following in the footsteps of her military family. In school, she’d dreamed of corporate life, business suits, a nice corner office. But the swarm took that away. Every able-bodied man and woman in her age cohort was funneled into hopeless defense of the colonies. By the time she was twenty-five, the cause was lost-- the colonies decimated, her family dead and scattered. Wildcat transferred into an elite unit to continue the fight."
"asw_bio_wolfe"	"Wolfe is an ex-con turned soldier. At his last sentencing, the judge gave him a choice: jail or the Interstellar Armed Forces. It was the chance he needed to turn his life around. He took top honors at boot camp, easily beating the other enlisted men at everything from hand-to-hand combat to special ordinance disassembly. When his sentence was up, he found that he not only liked military life, but was good at it--and was consequently offered a position in Special Ops."
"asw_bio_faith"	"Faith has the heart and soul of a medic. She's here to help people and believes in the Interstellar Armed Forces' mission to protect the Allied Systems against hostile alien assault. Despite having seen plenty of action, she’s still genuinely impacted by the human tragedy she sees and tends to take losses personally. She's deeply concerned for the welfare of her team."
"asw_bio_bastille"	"Leon Bastille was born on a prison world, child of a political prisoners; when political tides shifted, his family was released. It was a world run by black marketeers, where he learned basic medicine hands-on. He also received a strong, if informal, academic education (the prison being full of philosophers, authors, educators, poets and priests). Bastille is naturally suspicious of others, but also an excellent combat medic."
"asw_bio_crash"	"David Murphy, reputedly a child hacker genius at tech school, didn't take long to fall onto the wrong side of the law. At the age of 21, he was responsible for the notorious Starbase Systems Crash, allegedly costing the Trade Leagues millions in lost credits. Murphy is now serving time in the IAF as part of his sentence."
"asw_bio_flynn"	"Flynn's face is marred by a huge scar running across his left eye. He's a scrappy born fighter, raised on a grudge-world, settled by warring societies pursuing a deliberate generations-old feud, wracked by perpetual civil war. He's most comfortable with streetwar, guerrilla tactics, and dirty fighting. He's also most comfortable with large weapons. The bigger, the better. He talks little, his one good eye ever watchful."
"asw_bio_vegas"	"Vegas has an almost savant-like talent for counting and memorization, a skill he put to use in various gambling houses where he won big at poker and blackjack tables. However, fortune is fickle, and after racking up massive debts and angering some important people, he had to get out. Vegas joined the IAF so he could earn the money to pay back his debts (or a sizeable seed fund with which to win back the rest), and to get away from people who want to crush his kneecaps."

"rd_so_tips_drone"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Drones only attack with their claws. Taking them out before they reach the squad will render them harmless.\n• Certain drones have been known to leap large distances. Take extra precautions when using explosive weaponry, as targets may rapidly advance into unsafe range.\n• Drones can crawl through ducts and under scaffolding. It is sometimes possible to block the drones' points of egress, trapping them in a location where they are not a threat to marines."
"rd_so_tips_ranger"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• The ranger's acidic weapon travels at a constant height. Dodge roll out of the way for a clean escape.\n• Rangers lack a melee attack. The only risk in getting close to a ranger is a point-blank acid orb.\n• Rangers cannot turn while firing. Use this opportunity to flank or get into melee range."
"rd_so_tips_shieldbug"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• The large bone plates on the front of a shieldbug are completely invulnerable. Attack from the side or through gaps to do damage.\n• Shieldbugs have two stances. The \"offensive\" stance moves and turns faster, but reduces coverage from the bone plates. The \"defensive\" stance moves and turns slower in exchange for having its shields up.\n• Shieldbugs often switch to defensive stance when injured. It's often best to shoot one before attempting to flank to take advantage of its reduced movement speeds."
"rd_so_tips_boomer"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Boomers explode when provoked. If you see one inflating, it's wise to avoid the glowing blobs after it bursts.\n• Boomers are mainly dangerous because they burst, but they may attempt to kick you if you get too close.\n• Boomers are known to emerge from under walls or roll across the floor to menace marines."
"rd_so_tips_buzzer"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• The buzzer's main weapon is distraction. Their attack can disrupt a marine's vision for a few precious seconds at a crucial moment.\n• Buzzers are small, quick, and airborne. This makes them a challenge for projectile-based weapons - wise marines often find it easier to \"swat the flies\" with melee attacks.\n• Buzzers deal relatively little damage, but if left unchecked, they can be deadly."
"rd_so_tips_parasite"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Parasites reproduce with the help of human heads. If a parasite latches onto a marine, prompt medical attention is required to keep them from exploding into more parasites.\n• Electrified armor is the only non-medical way to prevent parasites from coupling with a marine's head once they attach. Fire, applied either to the parasite itself or the egg, will render the specimen infertile and unable to initiate the process.\n• Infested marines report their vision turning red. If medical care is unavailable, the wise and merciful option is to put them down with friendly fire before their body can be used to scatter more parasites."
"rd_so_tips_mortarbug"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Mortarbugs are larger, stronger rangers. Capable marines keep an eye out for mortar shots coming over walls.\n• Instead of acid, mortarbugs spit bombs that explode after a constant length of time.\n• Mortarbug bombs are capable of damaging aliens and marines alike. Swift marines can take advantage of this to help clear densely-packed swarms."
"rd_so_tips_harvester"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Instead of attacking directly, harvesters spawn xenomites to attack for them.\n• Marines should exercise caution when approaching a Harvester. They don't attack directly, but their skin is corrosive.\n• Harvesters are one of the few known specimens that will walk away from marines. You may have to chase them down to stem the tide of xenomites."
"rd_so_tips_xenomite"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• The only dangerous part of a xenomite is the acid sac on its behind.\n• Xenomites will attempt to jump onto marines and detonate themselves. Marines can refuse xenomites by killing them first.\n• Xenomites often indicate that a Harvester is nearby, but they're also known to exist independently."
"rd_so_tips_mender"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• The mender is capable of healing its fellow aliens with its stretchy, red and green tongue. Wise marines will find it difficult to stem the tide until it's dealt with.\n• Menders are considerably rarer than other alien species. Novice marines often panic their first time seeing one and waste precious ammunition causing quickly-healed wounds.\n• Menders are known to run away and regroup when the going gets tough. Cut them off before they get the chance."
"rd_so_tips_biomass"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Biomass is thought to fill a role in the alien life cycle. It cannot attack directly, but it is corrosive to the touch.\n• The only way to actually eliminate a biomass is to burn it off. Marines have to consider whether to bring fire or simply accept some damage to cross.\n• Some, but not all, biomass releases pheromones that call in a swarm when burned. Be prepared to fight when lighting unfamiliar biomass."
"rd_so_tips_grub"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Grubs have no weapons and very little health. They can be killed simply by stepping on them.\n• Parasites are often, but not always, nearby when grubs are present. Capable marines take advantage of this early warning.\n• A grub's only natural defense against boots is their ability to climb walls."
// Antlion guards are referred to as "horses" by players. "why the long face?" is a lighthearted way to ask someone why they look sad, but it's also the punchline of a common joke (horse walks into a bar, bartender asks "why the long face?", the joke is that horse faces are just kind of long because of their snouts)
"rd_so_tips_antlionguard"	"IAF Fact Sheet:\n• Marines who have fought uber drones will find the antlion guard familiar, albeit faster and larger.\n• The antlion guard's primary weapon is the chitinous battering ram on their snout, giving them a distinctively long face.\n• Antlion guards come in two flavors: brown guards and glowing yellow guardians. They have otherwise identical bodies but behave differently."

"rd_so_paragraph_drone_0"	"03/28/43, 15:23\nI don't think we'll ever truly understand these. There's so much to learn about their morphology, their behavior, even where they came from. Everything we do know came at a great human cost. I've recorded nearly fifty different variations on the same body plan. Triple that if you include the mutations I've confirmed firsthand. I've been trying to assemble the scant rumors of drones rapidly mutating astonishing new capabilities and carapace coloration. If even half of these are true, I worry we may never be able to catalog every possible variation, much less stamp this cancer out once and for all."
"rd_so_paragraph_drone_1"	"04/03/43, 08:14\nThey aren't natural. Even if they were an evolved species at some point, there's evidence of experiments turning some existing being into these colony-destroying parasites. This goes a long way to explaining their remarkable genetic diversity. If the only common ancestor is some experimental parasite, it means whatever monsters created these things wanted to find the best possible hosts for their sick experiments. If the anthropogenic hypothesis offers one ray of hope, it's that we can find some kind of cure. Both for our sake and theirs. I have to believe there's still a chance to cure the galaxy of this alien swarm. There's got to be a better way than risking IAF lives and detonating stations after every last human's been dead for weeks."
"rd_so_paragraph_drone_2"	"04/14/43, 20:42\nI've been exchanging correspondence with Dr. Scenario. It's still early days while we figure out if we can trust each other, but she has some fascinating data. She's not IAF, but that may be for the best. I worry my research into the swarm is a career-limiting move, especially after what happened on Nam Humanum, but I have to know. If I can prove where they came from - if they came from anywhere at all - it's possible no one will ever have to die to these things again. Perhaps one day, I'll be able to walk down a dark hallway without hearing phantom skittering over my shoulder."
// "the Office" is short for "the Office of Consensus Maintenance", though Julie doesn't know that yet. See the Shieldbug entry for more context
// "deal with the devil" (or "devil's bargain" or "Faustian bargain") is an idiom meaning "to abandon one's moral principles for some other benefit"
"rd_so_paragraph_drone_3"	"04/20/43, 18:35\nHelvetica's making a lot of sense. I suspect my days with the IAF are numbered. She's promised me a place in the Office- not that she'll tell me what that means. If it's somewhere I can study the swarm with some actual support from command, I'll jump ship in a heartbeat. The only issue is whether to trust when my gut tells me I'm at a global maximum right now. It's possible that any move I make is the wrong one. I can't tell if I'm about to make a deal with the devil, take a life preserver off this sinking ship, or paint a target on my back."
"rd_so_paragraph_drone_4"	"04/20/43, 23:55\nI now realize the devil may carry a life vest in one hand and a paintbrush in the other."
"rd_so_paragraph_ranger_0"	"The thing about space is that it keeps coming up with new and exciting ways to kill you. They invented a mouth on legs that spits acid at you and the best defense is a somersault. We had to work out a system where one of us distracts it with acrobatics and bullets while everyone else hits it with a stick. If they ever figure out how to look up or down, it's gonna be a lot more work for us. It's like these space bugs don't even care that I have other work to do. You can tell them these science crates have somewhere to be, but they're not gonna listen. I'm not even sure they have ears. Just legs and a mouth."
"rd_so_paragraph_ranger_1"	"Just the other day, I was trying to get some space lunch. They had acid orb soup, acid orb pie, acid orb pizza, you name it. Turns out one of these bugs got loose in the kitchen and our chef made the best of it. I don't recommend it- I got nasty heartburn and the doctor kept asking if I was lying. They tell you that you can roll around to avoid the spitballs, but that doesn't work when they're already inside you. I feel like if I had dodgerolled while eating the soup, it would have gone down a lot more easily."
"rd_so_paragraph_ranger_2"	"Some clown tried juggling the acid balls once and I'll be the first to admit it was pretty funny until their gloves started to melt. It was even funnier when they tried to wash it off in the soup, and hilarious when it melted right through their horn. It's a shame- they were doing great at the tactical clown rolls until they decided to show off. I like to think we all learned a valuable lesson about clowning around when there's acid bugs scuttling around: it can be really good if you do it right."
"rd_so_paragraph_ranger_3"	"If there's any consolation, it's that they like to sleep as much as anyone. I found one sleeping in my bunk last night and it was just easier to let sleeping bugs lie. They don't spit so much when they're all curled up with their legs over their face and the only thing worse than getting melted by a bug in your bed is having everyone get mad at you for waking them up with a gunshot. Honestly, I've had worse bunkmates. They don't hog the blankets or pillows and they help regulate the temperature under the covers. Just make sure you get up before it does."
// calcium carbonate and bismuth subsalicylate are common antacids - medication for an upset stomach or heartburn. also, Bug Report (pronouns they/them or she/her) is a pun on the fact that they're a bug (as in an insect) and on the phrase "bug report" (as in filing a report about a computer problem)
"rd_so_paragraph_ranger_4"	"I'm starting to think they're not so bad if you know how to take care of them. The right diet, rich in calcium carbonate and bismuth subsalicylate, can take a lot of bite out of the acid. Frequent belly rubs, leg massages, and daily walks keep Bug Report here mostly docile, even if they do still try to melt the leash when I'm not looking. I want to ask the doctor if there's some kind of surgery or gene mod for the acid, but she just asks if I'm trying to make soup again and laughs me out of the room. I don't know how to tell her that she's the one that can control the rate at which the bug produces soup ingredients."
"rd_so_paragraph_shieldbug_0"	"04/25/43, 09:55\nThere are entire species out there I could never have theorized. Helvetica's been leaking me documents that outline completely novel alien species. These \"shielded bugs\" have indestructible natural armor on one end and a very vulnerable-looking glowing blob on the other. If these are, in fact, the product of genetic engineering, the implications are staggering. Could we create IAF marines that are harder to kill? Or an organic source of armor plates so we don't have to scavenge scrap metal to reinforce the hull? If a living thing can be modified to produce something like this, we should be able to do so much more with this technology. If we're starting from immunity to bullets, resistance to disease and infection should be trivial. I only hope I get the chance to use it for good."
"rd_so_paragraph_shieldbug_1"	"04/26/43, 11:09\nIt's becoming abundantly clear that the Interstellar Armed Forces have no interest in my research. The meatheads in command won't even listen to what I have to say. I can claim it's going to save money or time or lives, but as soon as they catch a whiff of alien research, they kick me out. \"Our job is to shoot aliens, Professor Duval.\" This is usually when they stand up and start yelling. I can still feel the flecks of angry spit on my face. \"Not share DNA with them.\" They usually use much stronger language. I worry they don't truly understand the aims of my work, but that may be for the best. If they're not going to appreciate my research now, it'd be disastrous if they tried to use it without me. I shudder to think what the bosses here would do with no expertise, no oversight, and wild dreams of what they can accomplish with genetic engineering. Even if my research really is useless, I have to make sure the IAF doesn't use it to create another scourge."
"rd_so_paragraph_shieldbug_2"	"05/02/43, 08:32\nI'm pulling the trigger. Exit strategy implemented. No turning back now. I'm deleting what I can get away with and falsifying what I can't. Just a little bit every day. By the time I leave, I'll have the only real copy. Helvetica says she's preparing a place for me at the Office. If I'm lucky, I'll find out what OCM stands for. It's either that or I'm making a powerful enemy and burning every bridge I have because a pretty redhead made me realize how much I hate my job. At least, that's what she tells me. You don't exactly attach pictures of yourself when you're exchanging confidential messages about alien biology, work conditions, and sedition.

I saw the furniture just instantly reduced to splinters and shrapnel. I watched people I knew - friends and coworkers - vanish too fast for the security cameras to see. All that's left of them are the stains on the wall. These horrible, wretched things have to be eradicated. They're a wound on the galaxy that's only going to get wider and deeper unless we treat it.

The real monsters at AMBER are the executives and managers that let it get this far. The real boomers we should have killed are the wretched old men who think the galaxy belongs to them. The aliens can really only kill a roomful of people at a time and they're nice enough to make it quick. The humans in charge have been slowly squeezing the life out of everyone they can get their hands on. They've been grinding thousands of people, soul-first, into dust for years.

I kept my eyes closed on the way out, since it's not like I could see anything through the thick layer of caked-on bug corpses.

I assume it's because I did such a good job with the buzzer infestation and because I can get Bug Report to sit on command about 41 percent of the time. That's my best guess. My commanding officer just shouted \"Bur! Bug! Go!\" over the radio and I kinda had to go from there. I'm not totally sure if I'm supposed to train the bug or kill her or what.

// In the US, at least, bowling alleys play weird animations when you get a strike/spare/gutter ball/etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQqWcDJ2v2U
"rd_so_paragraph_mortarbug_1"	"So I took the bug bowling. I figured that if she wants to spit orbs, the least she can do is aim it away from anything that screams- which does mean we have to replace the screen that keeps score. I think the sudden music and dancing bowling pins gave her mixed messages, so I can't really blame her for blowing it up. It's not like it's hard to keep score for her - turns out it's really easy to bowl a strike every time when the balls explode. She doesn't even need bumpers! Which is fortunate, because they're splinters now. The tricky part is trying to get her to shoot forward instead of up. There's no rule that says you have to roll the ball, I guess, but I feel like air striking the pins is against the spirit of the game."
// the joke here is that a "throwback" usually means "we're doing things like we did in the past", but the bowlers take it to mean "throw the balls backward".
// "they used to bowl with eight or nine pins back in the day, and they liked it!" is both true (modern American bowling is played with 10 pins, it evolved from a similar game played with 9 that is still played in some parts of the world) and a reference to a way old people stereotypically talk. "Back in my day, things were a lot worse, and we liked it fine!" is a common joke template. ("back in my day, there were no school busses! we walked uphill to school both ways, and we liked it!")
// dodgeball is a game where you throw (typically foam or rubber) balls at the other players to get them "out". rollball isn't anything, it's just a joke way to refer to bowling that also ends in "ball".
"rd_so_paragraph_mortarbug_2"	"The main problem is that we are running out of usable pins. The other bowlers are starting to get upset that they have to bowl with less than a full set. I tried to tell them about the history of the sport - they used to bowl with eight or nine pins back in the day, and they liked it! I tried calling it a throwback night, but now balls are flying everywhere but the lanes. It's one way to save wear and tear on the pins, but it's rough on the carpet, chairs, and other bowlers. Personally, I think it adds a fun twist when you gotta play dodgeball and rollball at the same time."
// "Bugsketball" is a portmanteau of "bug" and "basketball".

"rd_so_paragraph_mortarbug_3"	"03/25/53, 23:08\nIt is setting a bad example for Big Report, though. She was doing so good at the bowling alley until Throwback Night surprised her. I thought bugsketball would be a perfect fit for her, but the less said about that, the better. So I'm changing tactics again and signing her up for the baseball team. She's got a great pitching mouth on her, so I figured we could use that. I haven't gotten her to throw baseballs yet, but the bombs are really motivating the batters and fielders to do their best. Plus, now every home run comes with its own fireworks display. The only problem is that nobody wants to play catcher. I offered to make the padding thicker and more acid-resistant, but I'm thinking we're just gonna have to use the bomb shelter as a backstop for the time being."

// "Basebees" is a portmanteau of "baseball" and "bees" because they're baseball-shaped bees.
// in the game of baseball, a runner is "tagged out" if a player on the opposing team touches them with the baseball before they can reach a base. doing this means they must stop running and are "out". (but tagging them with something else, like an empty glove or a bee, does nothing.)
// to explain "fielding all the pieces": in the game of baseball, after the batter hits the ball, they will run around the bases. if the batter hits the ball hard enough (and in the right direction), it will land in the outfield. The outfield is between the bases and the edge of the field where the spectator seats are. It's the "outfield" because it's the outer part of the field. Anyways, the job of the outfielders is to stand in the outfield, catch any balls that are hit their way, and throw those balls to their teammates on first, second, third, and home base so that they can tag the runner out. (This is a simplification of the actual rules, but it will hopefully suffice.) This process of catching the ball and throwing it where it needs to be is called "fielding". A player that successfully catches and throws the ball where it needs to go is a "good fielder". In this case, this is difficult to do with an exploded ball because you have to catch all the pieces and tag the runner with all of them! This might be able to be simplified to "you have to catch all the pieces" or something.
// regarding "mercy rule": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule
// the last line is a play on the American English idiom "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game." It was originally said about baseball, but it's often applied to every sport and, really, any other endeavor. It's typically said to emphasize the importance of sportsmanship (playing fair, losing gracefully, etc.)
"rd_so_paragraph_mortarbug_4"	"03/28/53, 18:52\nWell, today was the big Space Series championship. Big Report pitched, of course, for the Upper Deck Robust Rookies against the Lower Deck Bosco Orbs. True to their name, the Orbs managed to genetically engineer some ball-shaped basebees to play outfield. I think they heard we had an insect player and refused to be outdone. The bees are not as effective as you might think - they find it hard to lift the gloves and put them in the way of the ball, even if they can fly. They mainly affect the game by being about the same shape as a baseball, so you gotta make sure you're getting tagged out by the right orb. If you get tagged out by a bee, you can keep running! I did manage to get Big Report spitting baseballs before the big game, even if they are covered in a thin layer of time bomb juice. This usually led to the balls either going off in the catcher's mitt (relatively harmless once we armored the glove) or exploding in midair after the hit. Very pretty, but it turns out that if the ball explodes, you have to field all the pieces. Long story short, the mercy rule made us call the game once we were losing 68 to 1. I still count it as a success. It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you taught a bomb-spitting space bug to play the game."
// The line about his bite is a riff on the English idiom "his bark is worse than his bite". It's meant to evoke a dog- one that barks a lot but won't actually hurt you much- and can refer to someone who makes a lot of empty threats with little to no ability to carry through on them.
"rd_so_paragraph_harvester_0"	"Good news, I'm still alive. I had a few close calls, but those monsters at AMBER haven't gotten me yet. This one's for you, Captain Bark.

A certain someone signed off on the HARVESTER project! Specimen 8'1'18'22, here we go. These guys are nasty. You monsters weren't content with wretched mutants choking the life out of the galaxy one by one, you had to make a whole line of mutant factories. Couldn't do all the dirty work yourself, so you made a damn pyramid scheme. Why make one problem when you can make an infestation that festers and multiplies? Brilliant work all around. Give yourselves some medals."
// "grow up big and strong" is often said to encourage children to eat. Like "Eat your vegetables so you'll grow up big and strong!"
"rd_so_paragraph_harvester_1"	"I guess it only makes sense. Capitalists rarely do their own dirty work. They have people for that. They withhold your livelihood and make you dance to their tune if you want to eat. They don't say it like that, of course. They don't have to. They just make sure food costs money and they just so happen to have a paying job right here. The job might not even be so bad. Maybe you email spreadsheets around to make sure the murderous mutants have enough food to grow up big and strong. For every one black-hearted monster strip-mining life from the universe, there's thousands of people who are forced, implicitly or otherwise, to spend their precious remaining years making it happen. Why put yourself in harm's way when you can run away, hide somewhere safe, and send your underlings to do it for you?"
"rd_so_paragraph_harvester_2"	"And once you realize this, the walls start closing in. You might not be consciously aware of it or be able to put words to the feeling, but you can feel it pushing at the corners of your mind. Just constantly squeezing you in its vice grip. The job isolates you because capital doesn't want you to have friends or loved ones. That would get in the way of work. If you don't work hard enough, you won't get to do any more work. You can go starve to death somewhere out of the way. Get back to selling the sand in your hourglass, grain by grain, peasant."

It is that sense that's used here- it could be replaced with "strike breaker" or whatever local equivalent you have for "the people brought in to do violence to striking workers until they get back to work".
"rd_so_paragraph_harvester_4"	"There's a way out, of course. They need us more than we need them, and they can't kill all of us. Especially if all the guys holding the guns realize they're getting a raw deal, too. That's the thing - we're all in this together. The catch is that it only works if we do it together. They'll try every trick in the book to force us back to work. They'll break our legs. They'll let us starve. They'll put guns to our heads. They'll hire goddamn Pinkertons to blend in with us and drive us apart. They'll load up an armored transport with the biggest guns they can find and fire in every direction because they might hit someone who dared to want a better life and scare everyone else into falling in line.

// "the thick, choking smoke to the fire with acidic skin" is comparing the xenomites to the harvesters with the English idiom "where there's smoke there's fire", meaning that where there is a hint of something happening (smoke), it could be a sign of a larger problem (fire).
"rd_so_paragraph_xenomite_0"	"Speaking of big, glowing weak points and obnoxious parasites, I bring you specimen 24'5'14'15, codename XENOMITE. Can't talk about harvesters without talking about their exploding babies. The main reason harvesters are dangerous are because of these little monsters. The thick, choking smoke to the fire with acidic skin. That's the thing about being trapped in a burning building. You'll choke to death with burning lungs long before your skin sears. The foot soldiers and hired thugs will leave you battered and broken long before those gilded hands even have to try to wring your throat.

// for context on Bug Report and Big Report, see the Ranger and Mortarbug entries
// a secret listening device is often called a "bug" in English. a room with a hidden microphone that people in the room don't know about is said to be "bugged". also, insects/arthropods/anything that's sufficiently small and flies or crawls in general are referred to as "bugs".
// "bloodatorium" is a made-up word. the joke is that it makes some kind of sense to keep mosquitos in a place where there's blood for them to drink.
"rd_so_paragraph_mender_0"	"04/02/53, 20:18\nWe're developing a reputation as the space station that knows what to do with bugs. After Bug Report and Big Report, everyone else started unloading their bugs on us. We've got crates full of bees, mosquitos, and tiny microphones. We can put most of them to good use easily enough. Bees go to botany, mosquitos go to the bloodatorium, and I think I've bugged basically every room in the station at this point. Anyone can talk to anyone else from anywhere! The noise is unbearable, but I think it's a price worth paying for progress. The toughest nut to crack so far has been this weird doctor bug that showed up in a crate one day. We sent her over to medical, so we'll see if they appreciate that long, weird tongue."
// in English, "glowing" can mean either "emitting light" or "[a person] feeling and expressing pleasure or satisfaction"
"rd_so_paragraph_mender_1"	"04/05/53, 15:22\nSo, the doctors really love the new bug, but not for the reason I hoped. I assumed that, since the new guy is really good at fixing up other bugs, they could put her to work fixing up humans, too. And she does do that. The healing lick works great. The wrinkle is that it fills in the gaps with bug. We have guys who were missing legs that are now click-clacking down the hall happy as can be on chitinous little points. Half the cafeteria staff have scald-proof exoskeletons on their arms to fearlessly reach into soup. The bartender's got a big, bioluminescent acid sac where his eye used to be, and he loves it. Every time I see him at work, he's positively glowing and the drinks have more of a kick than ever."
// "bugsona" is a play on "fursona". since a fursona is a given human's idea of what they'd be as an anthropomorphic animal, a bugsona would be the same thing but specifically for bugs.
"rd_so_paragraph_mender_2"	"Naturally, the doctors find this fascinating. They keep saying stuff about \"exciting new genetic research opportunities\" and \"a way to save money on cybernetics\" and \"finally, I can become my bugsona\". Everyone is just a big fan of the bug. They're practically lining up to get a blast of that good, good healing tongue. Can you really call it \"healing\" if you're plugging the holes with spicy new bug goop instead of good old fashioned human flesh? The folks with the brand new arms seem to think so, and they seem like the experts here."

// re: "loaf": when a cat sits with its paws and tail tucked under its body, this is often called "loafing", because it's similar to the shape of a loaf of bread. if this doesn't translate, consider "curled up" or whatever else an animal that's comfortable on your lap might do. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catloaf
// "steamed hams" is a reference to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jXEuIHY9ic and to the vaporized cheeseburger suggestion in the buzzer entry.
"rd_so_paragraph_mender_3"	"04/06/53, 14:01\nAll this talk about spicy new bug goop made me hungry, so me and Bug Report paid a visit to the cafeteria. Big Report's been pretty busy with baseball practice, so we don't see her very much. Bug and I have a pretty good little routine where I eat and they loaf on my lap and eat whatever happens to fall. I usually have to drop a few antacids at the same time so they don't leak too much acid, but it works well enough. Today's lunch was this canister of liquified hamburgers, superheated and served as a vapor. Bug Report here must really like steamed hams - they got so excited, they clawed and melted right through my jumpsuit legs. So, naturally, I sought out our local mender to see if it could do anything about my bare legs. She could! It didn't do what I expected - my clothes are still in terrible shape - but all those little leg scratches got smoothed out with a shiny new layer of exoskeleton."

Every time we'd get a bump or a scrape, we'd take it by the mender to get mended up and get a little buggier every time. And, to be, clear, this rules. Everybug's skittering on the walls and ceilings so the hallways are now four times more efficient. I eat mostly sugar water and nectar, so I don't have to deal with whatever the cafeteria staff cook up unless I want to. Plus, me and Bug Report are closer than ever. Nobug's really scared of them any more and I'm starting to really dig the rhythm we get when our legs tap down the hall together. I just hope this nasty case of acid reflux dies down soon.

"rd_so_paragraph_biomass_0"	"12/31/52, 01:24\nThe electricity worked! I stripped a few meters of spare wire and wrapped it around my clothes. Some thick rubber gloves made sure I didn't immediately electrocute myself, and I was off to the races. The main wrinkle is that my head remains extremely exposed, but so far so good. I honestly think they can sense the electromagnetic field and that pushes them away. This implies you could effectively repel them with an antenna cut to the right length and relatively little current. The cables and electricity have got to be a relatively inefficient way of emitting the power. I'll have to sit down and do the math later to see if I can figure out the exact frequencies that repel them. Maybe I'll get lucky and find up a spectrum analyzer later. For now, I must bravely press on."
// "reach beyond my grasp" is a play on the English idiom "one's reach should exceed their grasp" or "your reach exceeds your grasp". It means that one's ambitions (their reach) are greater than what they can actually accomplish (their grasp).
"rd_so_paragraph_biomass_1"	"I have hit a problem I cannot solve with electricity alone. A vast stretch of biomass blocks my path. It quivers when I approach with the electricity, but I don't think it could move out of the way if it wanted to. Come to think of it, can it even want things? It certainly likes to eat corpses, but that might be in the same way a wood chipper likes to eat branches. Regardless. I'm getting distracted. This hallway is biomass, walls, floor, and ceiling, as far as the eye can see. I wanted rapid tissue generation and I sure as hell got it. It sure doesn't like fire - there I go again, anthropomorphizing it - but this base's atmosphere has an exquisitely combustible oxygen/nitrogen ratio and thing is way too big to shove into a furnace. Is this the dead end I deserve for daring to reach beyond my grasp?"
"rd_so_paragraph_biomass_2"	"06/18/53, 11:11\nThose were not spare wires, you- Sorry. Unprofessional. You ripped those out of the fire suppression system and left bare, live wires just hanging out of the wall. You didn't even cut them properly, you just grabbed and yanked. Because, hey, why do things the right way and make someone else's life easier when you can try to escape the consequences of your actions and leave a fire hazard in your wake? Your cute stunt with the \"spare\" oxygen scrubber batteries left the atmosphere unbreathable. People died. Endangering my team is one thing - they signed up for this. They knew they were going somewhere dangerous and did it anyways in the pursuit of knowledge and to help humanity. Not to win a damn Nobel, Shaun. There were innocent people on that station.

"rd_so_paragraph_biomass_3"	"For every self-proclaimed genius that just takes what he wants without thinking about the world he claims to want to save, there's people like me who have to clean up afterwards. Someone has to go back over the earth you salted and see if there's anything worth salvaging. I've read your notes, Shaun. I know what your coworkers and bosses had to say about you. My team braved the hellscape you created for this information, the least I can do is make sure nobody has to deal with your... let's say \"unique approach to problem solving\". I do my research. I think about what I'm going to do before I do it. Information isn't free, Shaun. Good information, reliable information, comes at a steep cost. Sometimes that price is paid in blood. And if you have that, if you have something people died to bring you, the absolute least you can do is make sure that price never has to be paid again. If you really were half the \"brilliant scientist\" you claim to be, you'd have thought about a single living soul other than yourself instead of locking the fire exits."
// "Bases" here means "things that are alkaline; the opposite of acids". Sodium bicarbonate is also called "baking soda", often used both for cooking and to neutralize acid spills.

Bases don't work. I thought the sodium bicarbonate would help neutralize the corrosive skin, but I think it just made the biomass angry. Sorry, anthropomorphizing again. I suppose I'm going to find out when I burn it. It's okay. I'm the genius that got us into this situation, I can get me out of it. I think I know where I can get a blowtorch. Just a little heat, delicately applied, should cut a swath right through the middle. I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner."
"rd_so_paragraph_grub_0"	"12/31/52, 03:24\nAlright. Things happened. I couldn't find a blowtorch, so I made do with a can of pressurized lubricant and Helen's secret lighter. Not that it's really a secret if you lock it in a drawer every time someone walks in. And, well, it worked on the biomass. Turns out there's a reason they don't let you bring open flame into the complex. The entire hallway just went up instantly. Lubricant touched flame and the fireball did not stop where it should have. The biomass is gone, but so are most of my hair and clothes. Turns out I was right about the oxygen mix. Once again my own brilliance curses me with foresight, but not the ability to prevent the inevitable. I'm a tragic genius, tortured by a world that refuses to understand me."

"rd_so_paragraph_grub_1"	"12/31/52, 03:30\nSo. Status report. The fireball consumed a lot of breathable air, and the oxygen scrubbers aren't working for some reason. There's some smaller blazes that the fire suppression system isn't dealing with, so that's worrying. The atmosphere is rapidly becoming unbreathable. There should be emergency EVA equipment nearby. The question is whether I can get there before I pass out. Wish me luck. If I don't make it, I will assume it was the universe choosing to punish me one last time because I dared to dream big.

This is crucial in reconstructing what happened here and Mr. Ming's journal has been invaluable in our endless battle against the alien swarm. His shortcomings and tactical errors aside, we'd be a lot worse off without his research. Of course, we must also consider that, without his actions, there would be a lot fewer aliens in the swarm and we would have more staff on hand to deal with them. The point of a document review is to distill the available information into something succinct, searchable, and salient. With that in mind, I suspect this will form a key part of our investigation into the Jacob's Rest incident. I just hope we can put this all behind us soon."

As far as we can tell, he didn't survive the ordeal. No one did. We found his journal abandoned on Deck 2. If I had to guess, I'd say he dropped it shortly before his demise. It's scratched in a way that's consistent with what we know about drone claws, so it's possible he was attacked. We never found a body, so he either got himself devoured or managed to throw himself into the waste disposal or something. The man who doomed Jacob's Rest died relatively quickly to the swarm he unleashed and the innocent people he doomed never had a chance. If he made any effort to repair the fire suppression system or restore power to the oxygen scrubbers, there's no record of it anywhere. There are multiple entries outlining the movement of grubs on his body in frankly unnecessary detail, but not a moment's consideration for the people he imperiled. I will resist the temptation to editorialize further, but I hope the conclusion is clear."

Before they learned the proper term, a lot of people started referring to these as \"horses\". They may lack the graceful spark of the horses we have on Earth, but I must admit I see the resemblance. Perhaps the humble Earth horse could take a few pages from the antlion's book. The hard head would make them difficult to pet, to be sure, but I think they're on to something with the colors.

If you're lucky enough to see one while the sunset shimmers, I find the chitin shines quite beautifully in the twilight. Sparkle aside, it's quite tough and useful for a number of military and industrial purposes. The hard part is separating it from the rest of the antlion. We've had some luck with crowbars, but several colleagues have suggested simply cutting the softer flesh away. I don't see any reason why this wouldn't work, but I'd like to verify it myself before someone loses a finger. I'd hate for someone to lose a pinkie to some pie in the sky idea about antlion surgery.

"rd_so_paragraph_antlionguard_2"	"I've seen some of you taking live specimens for further study. Good! They're fascinating creatures and there's a lot of work to be done. Do note that you should only thaw them out under controlled laboratory conditions. A good rule of thumb is that, when transporting an antlion, the container needs to be about twenty percent cooler than room temperature.

It consists of a baryonic transducer and a holding cell scarcely larger than an antlion guard. By manipulating subatomic vibrations, the transducer instantly cools the cage by approximately five degrees Celsius and maintains that temperature gradient indefinitely with very little additional energy required. Since the cold rapidly saps a captured antlion's energy, the walls only require minimal reinforcement. This alone makes them much easier to move around than the old freezer-on-wheels horse truck design! If our remaining tests pass, I will recommend we begin keeping these so-called horses in BOOTS. That would be a lovely win for all of us trying to safely learn more about these fascinating creatures."

They are hardly light on their pointy little legs and will not flutter shyly by while you watch. They will charge you, knock you down, and make themselves a problem until one of you dies. It's easy to forget that we're in uncharted territory here and there's so much we still don't know. Pushing boundaries and illuminating new frontiers of human knowledge is never easy or safe, but the risk can be minimized if we're careful and only take responsible, considered chances."

"rd_so_paragraph_antlionguard_5"	"To end on a lighter note, our research into proper antlion care and feeding has been going brilliantly. We've made good strides manipulating other antlion castes with pheropods, but that doesn't work with the guards. To that end, we've had quite some success with fruit and vegetables. They're quite fond of apples, jackfruit, and the occasional gourd. We've begun giving our captive antlions hollowed-out watermelons filled with other food, and they seem to enjoy the challenge! Remember, an enriched bug is a happy bug and a happy bug is far less likely to hurt someone on purpose. They do show affection through headbutts, so, once again, due caution and preparation are advised. Thank you for your time and attention, and I have faith that, in due time, we will find a way to keep these creatures docile in captivity.

Strange weapons have the same stats, appearance, and requirements as their non-Strange counterparts, but are compatible with \"Strange Devices\", tiny computers that track and display statistics about your weapon. (Strange weapons can currently only be equipped on the beta branch, but will become equippable in non-beta by the end of Phase 1.)\n• You will receive two boxes each containing a Strange Device of your choice.\n• You will receive a bonus set of crafting material locations (as if you had played for six hours).\n• You are encouraged (but not required) to give feedback about your experience with the Crafting Materials Beta on the Steam discussions forum for Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop or on Discord.\n\nThe following things will happen regardless of your choice:\n• Since January 2024, you have been passively finding a large quantity of crafting material locations by playing at least 30 minutes in a week and a smaller quantity of crafting material locations for every 6 total hours of play-time. You will continue to passively find these locations regardless of your participation in this beta.\n• Any crafting materials you find (either during the beta or after the full release) are yours to do with as you see fit.\n• You will eventually be able to craft strange weapons and strange devices.
