// Lt. Williams

"Command.co_m1_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, squad. We need to check the shipping manifests to see if any survivors made it off this rock. Make your way down to the landing bay and find a terminal where we can download the transport records. I'll check in with you there."

"Command.co_m1_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Well, these manifests are useless. Guess record keeping wasn't exactly high on the priority list when the swarm hit. We are now search and rescue until otherwise informed, so keep an eye out for survivors. Head for the far exit and then we'll regroup."

"Command.co_m1_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> All right, keep going! Main colony's dead ahead!"

"Command.co_m1_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Keep the elevator down to the main mining complex and forward formation to the entrance."

"Command.co_m1_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> I'm picking up multiple inbound motion signatures. Something tells me these ain't friendlies. Try to hold out until the elevator arrives."

"Command.co_m1_ob6"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We better get to the colony to see what we can find."

"Command.co_m1_ob7"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We can't get to the colony from up here, we need to get down to the lower level."

"Command.co_m1_ob8"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Get to the exit!"

"Command.co_m2_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> The situation isn't pretty. This next sector is completely overrun. There's a pipeline that the Swarm's using as a superhighway to spread through the colony. You go ahead and find the pipeline, and I'll see if we can figure out a way to destroy it. We need to stop these bugs from getting out."

"Command.co_m2_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Looks like we weren't the only ones who knew the Swarm were using the pipeline. That's a lot of boom packed around that pipe. Miners must have rigged the explosives but never got the chance to set em off. How about you finish what they started?"

"Command.co_m2_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> That's the pipeline right above you. Go ahead and blow it now!"

"Command.co_m2_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Looks like power's out in the next area. I got an idea though for lighting up your way."

"Command.co_m2_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, I'm sending in Bloodhound to see if I can't shed a little light on this problem. You try and stay in her lamps while you're crossing the bridge, you should be all right."

"Command.co_m2_ob6"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Good job. Now get across."

"Command.co_m2_ob7"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, I'm gonna bring Bloodhound in low and hover. You climb across her back while she's waiting. Step lightly now. She's gotta bring you home at the end of this."

"Command.co_m2_ob8"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Colony reactor is dead ahead."

"Command.co_m3_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay Squad, command wants the computers up and running. The colony's reactor was knocked offline by the Swarm attack, so you need to find your way to the reactor core and get that juice back on in there."

"Command.co_m3_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Great job, team! Power is on. Command is accessing the colony's computer systems right now. Keep moving, and we'll regroup up ahead."

"Command.co_m3_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, Squad. Word just came down from on high. I'm gonna be straight with you, it's all bad. Command didn't like what the colony's computer system had to say. Looks like the colonists are dead. Means the infestation is out of control, and they've decided to introduce the Swarm to the wonders of the nuclear age. They've uploaded detonation codes into the mine's nuclear excavation device—basically a nuclear warhead—and they need you to deliver it into the heart of the Swarm's nest. Head toward residential, and I'll find you a path to the bomb."

"Command.co_m4_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> All right, sensors show a massive build-up of eggs and biomass in this sector. Make yourselves a little room to work. Clear out the infestation. Burn them if you have to, but be advised, destroying biomass calls the Swarm."

"Command.co_m4_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Looks like more biomass ahead; get a firing solution on that problem."

"Command.co_m4_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> All right, you've almost cleared out the last of it. Keep pushing forward."

"Command.co_m4_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Just a few more eggs to go."

"Command.co_m4_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> You cleared out the area, time to get to the Swarm nest. Take the elevator down."

"Command.co_m5_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay Squad. I'm picking up major swarm at sewer junction 16."

"Command.co_m5_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> I'm picking up massive kinetic signatures in one of the old maintenance tunnels. Remember, these eggs are full of parasites. Take 'em out on sight."

"Command.co_m5_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay Squad. Moisture's dripping off those walls. Looks like an ideal breeding ground for swarm parasites. Keep a sharp eye out. If you get infested, call a medic. Your best chance is to destroy the eggs before they pop."

"Command.co_m5_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, team, we need to seal the tunnel entrance. This will help keep the swarm off your backs as you move deeper into the colony."

"Command.co_m5_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, Squad. I think I've found a shortcut for you. I'm detecting a breach in the facility's northwest wall. Move the squad through that breach and regain access to the surface."

"Command.co_m6_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Alright, the bomb is just up ahead!"

"Command.co_m6_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We've got new kinetic signatures breaking out all across the map. This doesn't look good."

"Command.co_m6_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Alright, there's the bomb! You'll need to use the mine's rail system to get that thing into the nest. Remember, losing this fight is not an option. We're gonna sterilize this rock right down to its bare molecules."

"Command.co_m6_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Okay, first thing's first. You need to reactivate the power substation for the cable railway. This'll start the warhead on its path toward the breeding chamber."

"Command.co_m6_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Alright, there are two doors that you're going to need to hack to move the warhead into position. Get 'em open."

"Command.co_m6_ob6"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Once the warhead is in position, activate the detonation sequence. After that, you're gonna need to back-track your way up to the surface to reach your extraction zone."

"Command.co_m6_ob7"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Alright squad, the clock is ticking. You do NOT want to be there when that device goes off. Trust me, it would ruin your whole day."

"Command.co_m6_ob8"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Head out the same way you came! We'll pick you up on the surface!"

"Command.co_m6_ob9"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Gang, you need to be high speed, low drag on this operation."

"Command.co_m6_ob10"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Time is running out! You've got to pick up the pace."

"Command.co_m6_ob11"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> You need to hustle. You're almost out of time."

"Command.co_m6_ob12"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Squad, you need to run like your lives depend on it. 'Cuz they do!"

"Command.co_m6_ob13"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> There's not much time left."

"Command.co_m6_ob14"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> You're running out of time!"

"Command.co_m6_ob15"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Pick up the pace, or you're not going to make it!"

"Command.co_m6_ob16"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Squad, you need to get out of there, NOW!"

"Command.co_m6_ob17"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Ten seconds left!"

"Command.co_m6_ob18"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> You almost made it."

"Command.co_m6_ob19"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> I'm sorry. I'll notify your next of kin."

"Command.co_m6_ob20"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> It was an honor serving with you. You will be remembered."

"Command.co_m6_ob21"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> It was an honor to serve with each and every one of you. You made the ultimate sacrifice."

"Command.co_m6_ob22"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Good work, mission accomplished!"

"Command.co_m6_ob23"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Mission accomplished!"

"Command.co_m6_ob24"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> You did it! The bomb's gone off! The Swarm threat has been exterminated."

"Command.co_m6_ob25"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> The nuke is blocked! Clear up the biomass to free it up!"

"Command.co_m6_ob26"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Landing pads overun! Bloodhound's coming in! Jump on our back and we'll get you out of there!"

"Command.co_m6_ob27"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Yeah! We made it!"

"Command.co_hold_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Alright, squad, you made it to the extraction zone. Command ship is inbound. You just need to hold out until I get there."

"Command.co_hold_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Almost there, squad."

"Command.co_hold_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Hang in there, squad. I'm on my way!"

"Command.co_hold_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Coming in hot!"

"Command.co_debriefing_ob1"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Objective completed! Good work, marines."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob2"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Analysis of the flight recorder from the escape pod shows a number of vessels did successfully break orbit and leave Vereon XII. Looks like a handful of SynTek officers and colonists."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob3"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We also show a small container left the atmosphere without broadcasting ID codes. All launch data for this vessel has been scrambled by persons unknown. We've dispatched scout vessels to search the immediate vicinity, but given its size and the unknown trajectory, the chances of finding it are slim."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob4"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Everybody has to be on that lift before it'll activate."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob5"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Good work destroying the pipeline, Squad. This should hinder Swarm movement within the colony."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob6"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We are showing the reactor back up and running at full efficiency. Great job!"

"Command.co_debriefing_ob7"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> The data you recovered shows a number of SynTek Security personnel attempted to fight back the infestation. We can assume at this point that they were unsuccessful."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob8"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> With the sewer access tunnel sealed, the Swarm have only one way to the surface."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob9"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> Excellent work, Commander. The thermonuclear device detonated by your squad has destroyed the bulk of the Swarm forces beneath the surface. We estimate in excess of 200 eggs and countless Swarm drones have been wiped out by the detonation."

"Command.co_debriefing_ob10"	"<clr:240,255,255><B>Lt. Williams:<B> We are still detecting a single large heat source in a deep, well protected chamber. IAF Command is making investigation of this a priority."

"Duval.03_01"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> This place is a maze... Our best chance, if we're to condemn the facility, would be to overheat its power source. A nuclear chain-reaction should be enough to cave the entire thing on itself. Looking at the design plans, we know that one of Lugdunum's cores is located within this floor's eastern section, alongside the...chief scientist's office? Huh."

"Duval.03_01_1"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> Of course. The only access to the east has been shut but, luckily, the corridor to the west appears to be leading to a remotely controlled defense station. If you find a way to make it work, that may be your ticket to the power core."

"Duval.03_02"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> It grows and spreads without restraint, like...a cancer."

"Duval.03_03"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> Commander... Some of these bodies are showing gunshot wounds."

"Duval.03_03_1"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> Or maybe we can prevent it from happening again, if only we knew..."

"Duval.03_04"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> There, that's the defense station."

"Duval.03_06"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> This...is Dr. Moreau's office. He seemed to have control on all communications coming in and out the colony... For whatever reason, he must have been the one to send the distress signal."

"Duval.03_08"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> One last thing Charlie, I've marked a database mainframe on your map, all you have to do is-"

"Duval.03_08_1"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> I know the mission. I'm sorry for putting you through this Charlie, but these datas could do more good now than they ever did harm! The terminal is located inside the chief scientist's office just south of your position. If you hurry, there's still a chance you can use his installation to upload the content into our ship's server!"

"Duval.03_09"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> I got it! To hell with ethics or chain of command. Now get out of there!"

"Duval.03_10"	"<clr:179,203,207><B>Prof. Duval:<B> Through the emergency exit, quickly!"


"Richard.01_01"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Charlie Squad, this is your commander. Professor Duval and I will be monitoring your progress throughout the searches. Communications are cut off from your end so be alert, we're still unsure of what to expect down there."

"Richard.01_03"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> ...looks like any of the other bugs to me, Professor. We're not here on a natural science endeavor, let this be clear already."

"Richard.01_06"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Just stay alive, marines."

"Richard.02_01"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> We know this installation employed some kind of rail system to move personnel around the facility. Hopefully you can still use one of their platforms but tread lightly squad, you're still in unknown territory."

"Richard.02_02"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> That's a negative. We've discussed this already, Professor."

"Richard.02_02_1"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Unless you're bearing knowledge to the attention of my men on the subject of bugs-killing, Ms. Duval, I'd appreciate radio silence on your part. You should know the mission as well as I do, and that it does not involve jeopardizing my squad's chance of survival in favor of some red herring."

"Richard.02_03"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Hit the switch marines, no harm in trying."

"Richard.02_04"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> You seem to have misunderstood our purpose here, Ms. Duval. As unprecedented as this may be to you, all that I'm willing to see down there is the most basic result of one sick game, an experimental playground for mad men who couldn't be bothered to look beyond their own personal amusement. It's a real mess, and we're the clean up crew. In more practical terms, it is by protocol that we now derive to a search and destroy objective. So if you were still confused, I reckon this is a clear enough choice of words?"

"Richard.02_04_1"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Good. Now, let's find a way to reach the bottom of this place and blow it sky-high."

"Richard.02_05"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> What in heaven's..."

"Richard.02_06"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Nice shooting, marines, you're nearing groundwork level. It's looking like you'll have to take the elevator shaft down into where they performed their “research”."

"Richard.03_01"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Don't get any big ideas, Professor. Just point my men in the right direction."

"Richard.03_02"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> It's even worse than I thought. This place is a ruin already, we're doing it a favor."

"Richard.03_03"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> So I see. Now you should all understand why we cannot let this be."

"Richard.03_03_1"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> I know enough."

"Richard.03_05"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Alright, that's the eastern door dealt with. Look alive soldiers, it's not over yet."

"Richard.03_07"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> That's fine work, marines. Be advised that once you set it all off, your only way out will be an emergency exit back at the junction. Now find me the controls to the power core and let us all be done with this place."

"Richard.03_08"	"<clr:191,195,167><B>Cmdr. Richard:<B> Leave it Duval, this is NOT the mission! Orders are to-"


"Pilot.01_01"	"<clr:236,236,236><B>Dropship Snakebite:<B> Good luck out there, we'll be in touch."

"Pilot.02_01"	"<clr:236,236,236><B>Dropship Snakebite:<B> Charlie, we've had reports of blizzard activity coming from HQ, we'll do a short rotation then get back to you."

"Pilot.03_11"	"<clr:236,236,236><B>Dropship Snakebite:<B> ...arlie, Charlie? Better move your asses before lift off."

"Pilot.03_12"	"<clr:236,236,236><B>Dropship Snakebite:<B> Glad you're in one piece, looks like you got it easy."


"Vesta.01_03"	"<clr:234,217,245><B>???:<B> Leave."

"Vesta.01_05"	"<clr:234,217,245><B>???:<B> Leave. Or join."

"Vesta.02_05"	"<clr:234,217,245><B>???:<B> Leave our home."

"Vesta.03_11"	"<clr:234,217,245><B>???:<B> Vesta...lives."
